# roife's dotfiles
## Installation
Firstly, check any box in `System Preference > Keyboard > Shortcuts` or some changes for keybindings wouldn't work.

As for Chinese, make sure VPN or Shadowsocks works well in terminal.

Run commands below

    xcode-select --install
    mkdir Document/github
    cd Document/github/
    git clone https://github.com/Roife/mac-setup
    cd mac-setup
    sudo ./init.sh

Restart after everything has been done!

## Attention
If you want to try, you should fork this repository first, then review these code and changes things you don't want. Don’t blindly use my settings unless you know what that entails!
