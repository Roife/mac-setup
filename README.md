## Installation
Firstly, check any box in `System Preference > Keyboard > Shortcuts` or some changes for keybindings wouldn't work.

If you're a Chinese user, make sure VPN or Shadowsocks works well in terminal.

Run commands below

    $ xcode-select --install
    $ git clone https://github.com/Roife/mac-setup
    $ cd mac-setup
    $ ./init.sh

Restart after everything has been done.

## Attention
If you want to try, you should fork this repository first, then review these code and changes things you don't want. Donâ€™t blindly use my settings unless you know what that entails!
